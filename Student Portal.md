# Student-Portal
A student portal is a web-based platform or application designed to serve the needs of students in educational institutions, such as schools, colleges, and universities. It provides a centralized digital space where students can access a wide range of academic and administrative services. The portal typically includes features such as profile management, timetables, attendance tracking, and event calendars. Here's a brief description of each component:

1. **Profile**:

   - Students can update their profile information, ensuring that the institution has accurate and up-to-date contact details.

2. **Timetable**:
   - The "Timetable" feature displays a schedule of classes and other academic activities for a specific student.
   - Students can view their class schedules, including the date, time, location, and course details. It helps them keep track of their daily and weekly commitments.
   - It can also provide options to view and download class schedules in different formats (e.g., PDF or calendar file).

3. **Attendance**:
   - The "Attendance" section allows students to monitor their class attendance records.
   - Students can view their attendance percentages for various courses or sessions. This feature helps them assess their attendance status and identify any potential issues.
   - Some systems may also send automated notifications to students when their attendance falls below a certain threshold.

4. **Calendar**:
   - The "Calendar" component provides an academic calendar with important dates and events.
